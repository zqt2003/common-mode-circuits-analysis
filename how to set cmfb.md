because the gain from cm control to output voltage is very large, the structure is a cascade amplifer, the gain is very large. so the common-mode feedback circuits should be low gain and wide bandwidth.

bigger the closed loop gain of common-mode circuit is, smaller the error between voc and vcm is.

However, there is a serious problem  that the current mirror control block will introduce a pole coparing with the DM circuits, so to meet the phase margin, we need to push the current mirror control pole 2.2 times larger than the the commonde circuits GBW.
